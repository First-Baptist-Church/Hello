There is only ONE WAY to God, and that's through His son, Jesus Christ.....

        Let God's love find you here!

Call to me and I will answer and tell you great and wondrous things you do not know.  Jerimiah 33:3

First of all, I want to say welcome!  I hope you will feel right at home as we celebrate this day that the Lord has made.  If you are searching for a church home, I'd like you to know that there is a special place here just for you.

This is a place to worship:

Everyone has a God created desire to have a personal experience with God.  We extend a call to every person, at every age level, to seek and find God in a meaningful experience of worship.  God has promised to reveal Himself to any that seek Him wholeheartedly.

This is a place of learning:

Studying the Bible is vital because it not only instructs us intellectually, but also guides us spiritually.  We believe and accept it as God's word to humanity, a book that is alive and relevant to life today.  Learning its truth is a thrilling adventure.

This is a place for friendship:

Nothing quite compares to the joy of friends who genuinely care.  That is why we make it a priority to build bonds of friendship between those who attend.  Best of all, this circle of care is ever widening.  We would love for it to include you.

                                                          Senior Pastor James D. Dunn
